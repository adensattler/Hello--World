libraries
- collection of reuseable code
- reduces need to re-write things from scratch
- use it however you want



frameworks
- a predetermined architecture
- you follow a specific development pattern
- you work within the boundaries defined by the framework



npm
npm (no capitals!) is a package manager 
- a gigantic repository of plugins, libraries, and other tools, 
which provides us with a command-line tool we can use to install these tools 
(that we call “packages”) in our applications.

--save-dev is used to save the package for development purpose. Example: unit tests, minification..
--save is used to save the package required for the application to run.

--save-dev installs and adds the entry to the package.json file devDependencies
--no-save installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file dependencies
--save-optional installs and adds the entry to the package.json file optionalDependencies
--no-optional will prevent optional dependencies from being installed
Shorthands of the flags can also be used:

-S: --save
-D: --save-dev
-O: --save-optional



bundlers (module bundlers)
A bundler is a tool used in web development that processes the source files 
of an application into static assets utilised by browsers. 
The primary purpose of bundlers is to organise modules and dependencies in 
front-end projects, optimise website performance, and reduce file sizes. 
This usually happens through minimising the number of HTTP requests and, in some cases, 
by increasing the number of queries (more bundles) to relieve the main bundle.

    - Vite: Build Tool (and development server and bundler)
        Im using it right now as essentially just a project scaffolder
    - Webpack: fkn complicated. try not to use...
    - Rollup: used by Vite!
