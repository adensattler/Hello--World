What is React?
React is a js library for building UIs(some say framework)! (bunch of prewritten code to make development easier)
Makes your code more scalable, readable, and way more efficient!

PUBLIC: The public folder is where all of the static assets related to your app will go. 
This could include images, icons, and information files for the browser.

SRC: Inside the src folder is where you will find the code that runs your app. 
The main.jsx file here serves as the entry point of the application. 

REACT IS DECLARATIVE! – What should be done ("just tell me what to do and ill worrry about how to get it done")
Imperative – How should it be done? "tell me every step"


JSX – JavaScript XML 
basically think of it as a flavor of js that is like html
React elements created by JSX are just js objects!


Elements:
the objects that get created when we return JSX


Component:
A function that returns React elements (ie jsx)

Fragment:
allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
